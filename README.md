# Payment form
## Introduction

This is a payment form application built using React. It leverages React hooks and controlled components to manage the state and behavior of the form elements efficiently.

## Features

- Implement controlled components for input fields, preferably as separate components.
- Implement automatic validation on input change - email must contain "@" symbol, name and address must have a certain length, etc.
- Display an alert message if the user presses the "Order" button without accepting the terms.
- After a successful order, display a new box below the input form with a summary of all data. Try to use a separate component for displaying the summary and conditional rendering.
